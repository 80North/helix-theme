## ðŸš€ Usage

To use one of these themes in Helix:

1. Copy the desired theme file into your Helix themes directory:

   cp %file%.toml ~/.config/helix/themes/
   ```

2. Open Helix and apply the theme with the `:theme` command:

   ```helix
   :theme %file%
   ```

3. To set it as the **default theme**, add the following to your `~/.config/helix/config.toml`:

   theme = "%file%"
   ```
